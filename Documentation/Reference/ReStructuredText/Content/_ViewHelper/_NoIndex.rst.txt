..  confval:: :noindex:
    :name: directive-viewhelper-noindex
    :type: bool

    If set the ViewHelper will only be displayed but cannot be linked and is not
    added to any indexes. This is useful if the same ViewHelper should be
    displayed in several places within the same document. In such a case there
    would be a clash of identifiers and warnings in the rendering if `:noindex:`
    is not set.

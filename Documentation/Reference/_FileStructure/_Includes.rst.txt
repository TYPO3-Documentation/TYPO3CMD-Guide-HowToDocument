Optional: :file:`Documentation/Includes.rst.txt`
------------------------------------------------

The :file:`Includes.rst.txt` is optional for Extension documentation. We use
it by convention in all official documentation.

By default it only contains a comment:

..  code-block:: rst
    :caption: Documentation/Includes.rst.txt

    ..  You can put central messages to display on all pages here

In the official documentation we use it to mark outdated and eLTS versions:

..  code-block:: rst
    :caption: Documentation/Includes.rst.txt

    ..  You can put central messages to display on all pages here

    ..  attention::
        TYPO3 v10 has reached end-of-life as of April 30th 2023 and
        is no longer being maintained. [...]

Before :ref:`migration <migrate>` to the new rendering it also contained
configuration settings. All those have been moved to the
:ref:`guides.xml <guides-xml>` or have been replaced by defaults in our theme
implementation.

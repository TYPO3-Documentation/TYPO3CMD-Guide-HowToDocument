Get help on writing documentation
=================================

If you wish to contribute to the docs, have questions about the
documentation or run into problems, the
`TYPO3 slack workspace <https://typo3.slack.com>`__
is the place to be.

In order
to join the slack workspace, you must `Register for TYPO3's Slack
Platform <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__. On that page,
you will also find information about the most important channels.

The channel **#typo3-documentation** is your channel of choice
for everything concerning TYPO3 documentation.

If you have some general TYPO3 support issues, please use **#typo3-cms**
for that.

If you are not sure which channel to use for your question you can
use **#random** where you get direct help or a hint for the right
channel.

.. hint::
   Do not ask if you can ask a question. Ask your question directly.


.. index::
   Help; Using documentation
   Slack; #typo3-documentation

Get help on using documentation
===============================

The same method as in :ref:`get-help-on-writing-docs` applies: Post
your question in the **#typo3-documentation** channel.

Don't worry, you will not be frowned upon if you don't know something.
Engagement and curiosity is a good thing! You may even have stumbled
upon something that is not documented well or is not user friendly.
In that case, let us know about it!

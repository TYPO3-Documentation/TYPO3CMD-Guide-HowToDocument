This chapter is an introduction and reference for writing documentation using
reStructuredText (also referred to as reST).

It is recommended to read (or at least browse through)
the :ref:`writing-rest-introduction` and the general
:ref:`format-rest-cgl` first.

Or, use the :ref:`rest-cheat-sheet`, which contains the most commonly used
markup on one page.

We cannot cover every reST markup that is
available. For more information, see other resources, such as:

*   `reSTructuredText reference by Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__
*   `reSTructuredText introduction on docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__
*   `reStructuredText Markup Specification <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html>`__

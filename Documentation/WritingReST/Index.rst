=========================
reStructuredText & Sphinx
=========================

This chapter is an introduction and reference for writing documentation using reStructuredText
(also referred to as reST) and Sphinx.

It is recommended to read (or at least browse through)
the :ref:`writing-rest-introduction` and the general
:ref:`format-rest-cgl` first.

Also read :ref:`rest-common-pitfalls` in order to avoid common
mistakes with the syntax or make sure to
:ref:`setup your editor or IDE <tools-for-editing-rest>` correctly
to detect and show errors in the syntax.

You don't need to read the entire chapter, just lookup
the section that is relevant for what you plan to do.

Or, use the :ref:`rest-cheat-sheet`, which contains the most commonly used
markup on one page.

We won't be covering every reST markup that is
available. For more information, see other resources, such as:
http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html

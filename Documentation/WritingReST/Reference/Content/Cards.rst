Cards
=====

Cards are used to group content together and provide a brief introduction on a given subject.

..  deprecated:: 0.2.40

    Cards were previously created by using nested :rst:`.. container::`
    directives with manually applied classes. The largest disadvantages were
    a large number of nested blocks and having to apply many classes.

    We discourage using containers for cards and suggest to switch to the
    cards directive.

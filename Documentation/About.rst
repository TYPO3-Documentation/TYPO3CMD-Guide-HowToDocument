How this guide is structured
============================

This manual covers writing TYPO3 documentation. This includes, contributing
to official documentation, the core changelog and system extensions and
writing documentation for third party extensions.

It is more than just documentation: it also lists some conventions, coding
guidelines and provides links to GitHub issues.

How to read this guide
======================

This manual introduces you to writing TYPO3 documentation. You can read
it cover-to-cover.

.. tip::

   Specifically, you might like to look at:

   *  :ref:`basic-principles` to familiarize yourself with the structure
   *  :ref:`conventions` for tips on coding guidelines, spelling etc.
   *  :ref:`reStructuredText & Sphinx Introduction <writing-rest-introduction>`.
   *  Additionally, keep the :ref:`rest-cheat-sheet` handy to look up the syntax.


But often, you would like to **jump right in**, start with a specific task
and learn as you go along. In that case, find your task here and start reading:

*  :ref:`how-to-start-docs-extension` if you have an extension and would
   like to write documentation for it using the sample extension manual.
*  :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` if you would like to contribute to
   the official documentation and need an easy introduction to editing
   documentation directly on GitHub. This does not require any development
   tools, you just need a browser and a GitHub account.
*  :ref:`docs-contribute-git-docker` if you would like to contribute to
   the official documentation and are already familiar with Git and Docker
*  :ref:`render-documenation-with-docker` if you would like to start with rendering the
   documentation locally with Docker.

This document was originally written by Martin Bless.

Special thanks to Xavier Perseguers, who wrote some of the original texts
in the retired TYPO3 Wiki and elsewhere. Some of the texts have been
incorporated into this document or at least served as a basis.

Further chapters like
:ref:`rest-common-pitfalls`, :ref:`rest-cheat-sheet`, :ref:`docs-contribute`,
:ref:`basic-principles`, :ref:`writing-doc-for-ext-start` and :ref:`docs-official-how-you-can-help`
were added by Sybille Peters.

A number of other people have helped by reviewing and refining the text
and pointing out missing information. For more contributors, see the
`list of contributors on GitHub for this manual <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/graphs/contributors>`__.

We thank everyone for their help and hope that good documentation
about writing documentation will make it easier for others to contribute.

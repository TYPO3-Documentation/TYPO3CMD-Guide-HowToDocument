About this guide
================

This guide was written to help the reader to :ref:`contribute to the official TYPO3
documentation <contribute>` and to :ref:`write documentation for their own
extensions <writing-doc-for-ext-start>`.

Documentation written in :ref:`reStructured Text <rest-quick-start>` can be
:ref:`rendered <rendering-docs>` using a TYPO3-specific theme and
automatically deployed to
`https://docs.typo3.org`__  by adding a :ref:`Webhook <webhook>`.

This document was originally written by Martin Bless.

Special thanks to Xavier Perseguers, who wrote some of the original texts
in the retired TYPO3 Wiki and elsewhere. Some of the texts have been
incorporated into this document or at least served as a basis.

Further chapters were added by Sybille Peters.

A number of other people have helped by reviewing and refining the text
and pointing out missing information. For more contributors, see the
`list of contributors on GitHub for this manual
<https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/graphs/contributors>`__.

We thank everyone for their help and hope that good documentation
about writing documentation will make it easier for others to contribute.

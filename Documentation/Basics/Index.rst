Common characteristics of TYPO3 documentation
=============================================

All of these examples have a few things in common:

*  The documentation is rendered and found on https://docs.typo3.org
*  The documentation has a **common theme**, all pages look similar and use the same styles
*  Most of the documentation can be directly **edited by the community**. For third party
   extensions, this depends on where and how the source-code is hosted and maintained.
*  The source of the documentation is written (mostly) in reStructuredText (**reST**)
*  All documentation is rendered using the **same rendering toolchain**. All documentation
   can be rendered locally, with the officially supported Docker image.
*  The documentation source files adhere to :ref:`file-structure`
   (for example all documentation files in a
   :file:`Documentation` subdirectory).
*  Due to the conventions, the rendering of documentation can be automated and
   every documentation project only requires a minimum of setup.

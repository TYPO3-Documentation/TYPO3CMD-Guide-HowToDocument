Everyone is welcome to make changes and help improve TYPO3's documentation.

No prior knowledge is required and support is always available for new contributors :ref:`here <how-to-get-help>`.

Once you have submitted your changes they won't be visible straight away. Someone in the Documentation Team
will need to approve the changes first before they are published.

**Workflows**

There are two different ways in which you can make your changes before submitting them for approval.

.. rst-class:: bignums

   1. Edit on GitHub

      You can edit documentation in your browser by accessing its repository directly on GitHub.

      This workflow is ideal for making minor changes such as fixing grammatical errors and typos.

      :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method`.

   2. Edit locally and render with Docker

      This method is suited to users who are comfortable using Git, Docker
      and the command line. It's the recommended approach for making larger
      changes as it gives you greater control over what tools you use and
      it also allows you to test and view your changes locally before submitting them for approval.

Workflow #1: "Edit on GitHub"
================================

.. youtube:: wNxO-aXY5Yw


First time contributor? Look at :ref:`contribute` for some general information about
contributing to TYPO3 documentation.

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

1. Get a GitHub account:

   `Join GitHub <https://github.com/join>`__

2. Find a page that needs fixing:

   Pick a manual, for example :ref:`t3start:start` or :ref:`t3install:start`
   and find a page there, that you want to change.

3. Click on "Edit on GitHub":

   You should find the button on the top right of any page!

   .. image:: ../images/edit_me_on_github.png
      :class: with-shadow

4. Fork the repository:

   Click on the green button to fork the repository.

   .. image:: ../images/github-edit-fork.png
      :class: with-shadow

5. Make your changes:

   You should now see an edit window where you can make your changes
   directly. The settings *"Indent mode: Spaces"* and *"Indent size: 3"*
   should already be correct, by default. Don't change that.

      :class: with-shadow

6. Handling reST:

   The files are written in reST format. You can :ref:`learn more about reST
   <rest-quick-start>` when you need it. For fixing simple typos and editing
   unformatted text, you should be ok without knowledge about reST.

7. Check Preview:

   Click on "Preview changes" to see what you changed and how the final result
   might look like.

   Go back to the edit window and make more changes any time.

   .. image:: ../images/github-edit-preview.png
      :class: with-shadow

8. Finalize your changes:

   When you are ready, scroll down to the bottom of the page. Add
   a short (!) text describing your changes and click on "Propose
   file change"

   .. image:: ../images/github-propose-file-changes.png
      :class: with-shadow

9. Create pull request:

   GitHub will now show you an overview of your changes. If this is
   ok, click on "Create pull request".

   .. image:: ../images/github-comparing-changes.png
      :class: with-shadow

   And finally, create your pull request:

   .. image:: ../images/github-create-pull-request2.png
      :class: with-shadow

10. You're done!

    Well, almost. Your change will now be reviewed. A reviewer might
    suggest changes. Monitor your notifications (email) from GitHub. If at any
    point, you are not sure what to do, don't hesitate to
    :ref:`ask for help <how-to-get-help>`. When your pull request is accepted,
    it will be merged. You will get a notification (email).


**Congratulations! You are now a contributor. Welcome and thank you!**

Wait a few minutes for the changes to be automatically rendered, and then
reload the page (which you fixed) in your browser.

Next month, you can find your name on the "Developer Appreciation Day"
(DAD) page on the `TYPO3 Blog <https://typo3.com/blog/tag/contribution/>`__.

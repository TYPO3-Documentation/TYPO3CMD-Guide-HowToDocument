===========================
How to render documentation
===========================

This page explains how to render a manual locally on your machine
with Docker in order to test the rendering.

Run these commands in a terminal in the parent directory of the directory
:file:`Documentation`. You should use a bash compatible shell, if possible.

If you run into a problem while rendering, check :ref:`rendering-docs-troubleshooting`,
`report an issue <https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation/issues/new>`__
or :ref:`ask for help <get-help-on-writing-docs>`.

    #.  Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

    #.  Preparations

        The docker image is not listed on Docker Hub (hub.docker.com) anymore, therefore some preparations
        need to be done once:

        ..  code-block:: bash

            # pull 'latest' version from GitHub container repository
            docker pull ghcr.io/t3docs/render-documentation

            # The "real" tag is independent of the container repository,
            # so let's just create that extra "real" and "generic" tag
            docker tag ghcr.io/t3docs/render-documentation t3docs/render-documentation

            # verify it worked
            docker run --rm t3docs/render-documentation --version

    #.  Make dockrun_t3rd available in current terminal

        .. code-block:: bash

            source <(docker run --rm ghcr.io/t3docs/render-documentation show-shell-commands)

        This will run the Docker container, in order to make the command
        `dockrun_t3rd` available in your current terminal. You must do this
        again for every new terminal you open.

        .. tip::

            If this command does not work on your platform,
            look at :ref:`render-troubleshooting-source`
            for alternatives.

    #.  Run dockrun_t3rd

        .. code-block:: bash

            dockrun_t3rd makehtml

        This will automatically find the documentation in the
        :file:`Documentation` subfolder. It will create a directory
        :file:`Documentation-GENERATED-temp` and write the results there.

    #.  Open generated documentation

        Look at the output of the previous command to see where the
        generated documentation is located or use one of these commands
        to directly open the start page in a browser:

        .. tabs::

          .. group-tab:: Linux

             .. code-block:: bash

                xdg-open "Documentation-GENERATED-temp/Result/project/0.0.0/Index.html"

          .. group-tab:: MacOS

             .. code-block:: bash

                open "Documentation-GENERATED-temp/Result/project/0.0.0/Index.html"

          .. group-tab:: Windows

             .. code-block:: powershell

                start "Documentation-GENERATED-temp/Result/project/0.0.0/Index.html"
